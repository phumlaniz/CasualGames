Your logo has a chilled, retro beach vibe with bold rounded lettering. Here are free web fonts that fit your style and are easy to implement:

Font	Style	Preview	Use
Fredoka	Rounded, friendly	
font-family: 'Fredoka', sans-serif;
Baloo 2	Bold & playful	
font-family: 'Baloo 2', cursive;
Nunito	Clean rounded sans	
font-family: 'Nunito', sans-serif;

You can embed one like this in your HTML:

html
Copy
Edit
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Fredoka&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
<style>
  body {
    font-family: 'Fredoka', sans-serif;
  }
</style>
ðŸ”§ Option 2: Generate a Fully Custom Font
If you want a unique custom font based on your logo style:

Use a tool like Calligraphr (lets you draw your own font).

Or try Fontself (a paid plugin for Illustrator/Photoshop).

If youâ€™d like, I can sketch out a basic alphabet sheet inspired by your logo that you can trace or edit to create your font.

Would you like me to:

Generate an inspired font alphabet design (Aâ€“Z)?

Or provide CSS samples with the fonts above applied to different web elements?

Let me know how deep you want to go with this!
